<p>In my current role as the Director of Engineering, Automation Infrastructure &amp; Performance Engg, for A10 networks across all product lines, I am responsible for enabling all of engineering to deliver quality reliable products that scale.</p>
<p>I am highly committed to creating world-class automation used in qualifying major company product releases. I have developed a continuous integration delivery strategy as well as have been hands-on in leading my team through daily decision-making. I have guided my team in designing automation software for various product qualification requirements and performance verifications. This infrastructure is used to qualify all the main and patch releases of all product lines of A10 today.</p>
<p>I have built the product expertise needed to help debug production issues and integrate with monitoring infrastructures. Various monitoring and reporting tools include memory analytics, resource usage at various stages of the product under test, comparison of performance across various releases, and builds of the product and code coverage reports for releases.</p>
<p>As the manager of the team, I have worked efficiently with cross-functional teams, understood product requirements, planned the team’s deliverables, and communicated effectively. I have been able to manage a fast-paced delivery schedule and drive high-level automation and performance measurement strategies, as well as take a hands-on approach to implement those strategies in partnership with the rest of the engineering leadership. Various self-initiated and driven tasks have been taken up by me and these have democratized QA across engineering teams. I have consistently earned the confidence of the CTO and the top management of the company. Consequently, I have received timely recognition and promotions for my work.</p>
