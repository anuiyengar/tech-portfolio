Top-performing passionate engineering manager with strengths in problem-solving, leadership, strategic thinking, and the ability to adapt to different situations.  

In my current role as the Director of Engineering, Automation Infrastructure & Performance Engg, for A10 networks across all product lines, I am responsible for enabling all of engineering to deliver quality reliable products that scale.

I am highly committed to creating world-class automation used in qualifying major company product releases. I have developed a continuous integration delivery strategy as well as have been hands-on in leading my team through daily decision-making. I have guided my team in designing automation software for various product qualification requirements and performance verifications. This infrastructure is used to qualify all the main and patch releases of all product lines of A10 today. 

I have built the product expertise needed to help debug production issues and integrate with monitoring infrastructures. Various monitoring and reporting tools include memory analytics, resource usage at various stages of the product under test, comparison of performance across various releases, and builds of the product and code coverage reports for releases.

As the manager of the team, I have worked efficiently with cross-functional teams, understood product requirements, planned the team’s deliverables, and communicated effectively. I have been able to manage a fast-paced delivery schedule and drive high-level automation and performance measurement strategies, as well as take a hands-on approach to implement those strategies in partnership with the rest of the engineering leadership. Various self-initiated and driven tasks have been taken up by me and these have democratized QA across engineering teams. I have consistently earned the confidence of the CTO and the top management of the company. Consequently, I have received timely recognition and promotions for my work.

## Current Role

## Director, Automation Infrastructure & Performance Engineering, A10 Networks - Jan 2019 - Present

- Automation infrastructure that plays a central role in the development and qualification of features across all product lines for every release. 
- Distributed and scaled infrastructure that supports orchestration and service provisioning of load-balancers (using CLI, GUI, and RestApi) and servers in on-premise and public cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI) as required for hardware/virtual/container versions of the product qualification. This is integrated as part of the CI/CD process with end-to-end automation using Jenkins and Terraform.
- Terraform integration to the infrastructure to support multiple public cloud vendors.
- Codeless automation: Integration of Behave framework to ATAF framework that removes the need to code automated test suites; thus providing the ability for engineers to automate test cases in a very short time that would otherwise take days/weeks. 
- Development of code coverage computing infrastructure that works at scale. Reduced total computing time from weeks to 5 days for the complete code base. The integration of the code coverage tool with the automated testing platform measures the coverage for each test case/ test-suite/feature code change. 
- Test impact analysis tool that suggests tests to run for a section of modified code based on the code coverage report and issues reported in the past test runs for the modified code.
- Performance engineering holds the core responsibility of providing the profiles to achieve the best performance benchmarks for every metric, on every supported hardware platform with different performance capabilities; and covering different specifications of virtual deployments (KVM, ESXi, BareMetal, Container, On-Prem, Public Cloud) of the product. Performance data is provided to the product, marketing, and sales teams at the end of every release ( https://www.a10networks.com/resources/datasheets/  ).  
- Robust and efficient automated performance infrastructure that’s designed to handle high-performing platforms, and traffic generators that are reliable and can scale. 
- Streamlined the process to benchmark performance data as required by the product, sales, and marketing teams.

## Senior Engineering Manager, Automation Infrastructure & Tools, A10 Networks - Oct 2016 - Dec 2018

- Scaled infrastructure distributed across different geographical locations with more than a thousand instances of load-balancers, Linux clients/servers, routers, and switches with the ability to qualify a product completely in a day; providing daily quality analysis of the release using automated report generation.
- 24-hour product release qualifying automation infrastructure that completes regression coverage in a day in a virtual environment (with multiple VM hosts and VM instances) for any product line of the company. Optimized the automation coverage to effectively get the test results in a day and help qualify any release in a short time with good code coverage. 
- Scaled and distributed infrastructure running hundreds of jobs in parallel at a time on 300 DUTs covering various product features. 
  
  --> DUTs include hardware platforms, and DUTs in virtual and container environments deployed on-premise and in public cloud infrastructure.
  
  --> Coverage includes system-level validation, validation of complete network stack features (L2-3, L4, L7), and applications (security, firewall, analytics, logs) running on the product.
  
  --> Completely integrated with automated code coverage and analytical tools to report memory leaks on any DUTs running any feature test.

- Productive tools developed have been useful in the early detection of critical issues that would not be possible to detect easily.
- Auto-generated automation reports are delivered to customers for every code drop.
- Automation reports generated for every release; including the resource usage/memory analytics, performance reports, and code coverage reports provide a concrete picture of the quality of the product at the end of a release cycle.
- In-house traffic generator orchestration. 
- Platform analytics tool using elastic search that dynamically polls for errors in different layers of the stack on A10’s thunder platforms and alerts the user with the error.

## Engineering Manager, Automation, A10 Networks - Feb 2014 - Sept 2016

- In-house built ATAF (ATen Automation Framework) automation framework used by every SDE team in the company for sanity and unit testing. This has had a huge impact on the code quality at the completion of the development cycle.
- Infrastructure handling 1500+ test suites. Test coverage is continuously enhanced in a CI/CD process followed within the product teams. These are used to qualify all main and patch releases of all product lines at A10 today.
- Support for REST-API in the framework based on JSON schema in Python for all product lines. 
- Data integrity tool that validates the payload of every packet passing through the device. 
- A tool to generate system resource capacity of all platforms of A10 that is published by the technical marketing team to be used by SEs. 
- Graphical reporting tool for memory analytics resulting in easy memory leak detection. 
- A graphical reporting tool that shows performance reports based on builds, releases, and platforms.
- Customer profile automation of large ISPs and public cloud providers that auto-generate reports required by customers for every code drop. Automation of customer-found defects.
- TCP stack automation in Python to detect any discrepancies in the stack. The test suite also covers RFC conformance tests.
- GUI automation. The interface between automation development and infrastructure to have appropriate APIs in place using the Selenium tool.


## Senior Software Engineer/Technical Lead, Automation, A10 Networks - Jan 2011 - Jan 2014

- As a Senior Software Engineer and Technical lead, I had the core responsibility to lead and develop automation library and feature test automation.
- I successfully led a team of 4 engineers supporting the automation of the company’s core product lines ADC and GCN.
- Performance automation developed is run on nightly builds to make sure there is no performance degradation on different platforms. This verifies the L4-L7, SSL CPS, and throughput numbers. A graphical report is developed that shows different performance reports based on builds, releases, and platforms.
- Automation development of feature validation for system and application-level features supported on different A10’s product lines:
  
  --> ADC/Application delivery controllers - L4-L7 server load balancing, GSLB, TCP, UDP, HTTP, Caching, URL Filtering, SSL offload, Diameter, Aflex, SNMP, Server Health Monitors, Session Management, High Availability, WAF, IP Anomaly detection.
